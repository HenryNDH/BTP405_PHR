## Project Report

Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience working within the Scrum framework and utilizing Docker Compose for Python and MySQL environments. Here are some key takeaways:

### Working with Scrum Model:

- **JIRA:** Worked effectively with JIRA to manage project tasks, track progress, and collaborate with team members.
- **Sprint Planning:** Prioritized tasks based on their value to the project and the team's capacity.

### Working with Docker Compose:

- **Environment Setup:** Simplified the setup of development environments by defining services, networks, and volumes in a single configuration file.
- **Isolation and Reproducibility:** Ensured consistency across different development environments.
- **Scalability:** Facilitated the scaling of services by defining multiple instances of the same service and load balancing between them.
- **Deployment:** Simplified the deployment process by packaging the application and its dependencies into portable containers.

Overall, working with the Scrum model and Docker Compose has been a valuable learning experience, equipping me with essential project management skills and improving my development workflow.
